# Deviance-based Logistic Tree (DbLT) Model

Welcome to the official repository for the **Deviance-based Logistic Tree (DbLT) Model**, an innovative approach to classification that synergizes the interpretability of decision trees with the predictive power of logistic regression. This model employs a unique criterion based on deviance, facilitating a robust selection of variables that uncover intricate relationships within your data. It's designed for analysts and data scientists who require a more nuanced view of their classification tasks, beyond what traditional models offer.

## Key Features:

- **Hybrid Modeling:** Combines logistic regression and decision trees for a comprehensive analytical tool.
- **Deviance Criterion:** Utilizes deviance for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables, optimizing the selection process.
- **Iterative Validation:** Validates each node through logistic regression, ensuring the reliability of the splits.
- **Pruning Techniques:** Implements various pruning methods to prevent overfitting and enhance model simplicity and performance.
- **Simulated and Real-World Application:** Demonstrates predictive performance through extensive tests on both simulated data and actual medical datasets.

## This Repository Includes:

- **Model Code:** The core DBLT model implemented in R.
- **Simulation Study:** Scripts to generate simulated datasets and perform model evaluation.
- **Usage Examples:** Practical examples demonstrating how to apply the DBLT model on different datasets.
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanation of the methodology, parameter settings, and interpretation of outputs.

Whether you're dealing with medical research data or exploring predictive analytics in other domains, the DbLT Model offers a fresh perspective with its fine balance of simplicity and sophistication. Dive into the repository to explore the code, understand the methodology, and start applying the DBLT model to your datasets!
